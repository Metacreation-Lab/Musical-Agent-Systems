# Musical-Agent-Systems
We will keep updating our musical agent systems developed by Metaceration Lab. Currently, this branch is mainly managed by Keon Ju Maverick Lee, a Ph.D. student.

MASOM, MACAT, and MACataRT musical agents are being refined before we release them here by the end of 2024, including demo videos of each system's behaviour.
